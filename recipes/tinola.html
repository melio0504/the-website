        <li>Pour in the water and add your Knorr Chicken Broth cubes. Bring this to a simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through.</li><br>
        <li>You can now add your sayote or green papaya and cook until tender.</li><br>
        <li>Dahon ng sili is added at the last stage to ensure leaves (and nutrients) don’t dry up. Give this a minute then it is done. Malunggay is also another healthy alternative because it is packed with vitamins and minerals which are good for nursing moms and kids as well.</li><br>
        <li>Enjoy this with patis and calamansi on the side. See the faces of your whole family light up as you bring this to the table.</li><br>
